## Crosswalk Notes

The final crosswalk is compiled from a variety of crosswalk documentation that was scattered across the internet. These crosswalks did not perfectly match the data that we used from the CPS. Below are a list of discrepancies that are accounted for in our final crosswalk. 

NOTE: There are sometimes categories listed on the IPUMS website that are not present at all in the data. Those are not noted here, rather, this is a list of items which we affirmatively modified our crosswalk to take into account. Items which are not present in the data have not been affirmatively added to the final crosswalk, and unused codes have not been removed or noted here. 

### Industry

#### 1971-1982

* 719: Only 2 individuals were assigned this code in the entire time span. May have been typos. Was not in original crosswalk. Has not been added to the final crosswalk. 

* 497: One individual is assigned this code. It does not correspond to any label, and is probably a typo. Not added to final crosswalk. 


1983 - 1991

* 991 has been added to the crosswalk in 1983-1991 and 1992-2002. It is listed as NA for all other years. 

* 382 and 522 are documented to have been removed in the transition from 1991-1992. They are crosswalked to NA for years following. 

* 940, 941, 942, 950, 951, 952, and 960 do not have a crosswalk into prior years, so they have been coded as NA.

* 9890 is present in the data beginning in 2003 and has been added to the crosswalk up to the last year. Years prior to that are NA. 

* 480 does not have a crosswalk into prior years, so they are coded as NA.
